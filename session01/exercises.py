# Now, can you turn this dataset into a pandas dataframe?
#   hint: use the list of dictionaries to initialize your dataframe

# What if you wanted to create a 3x100 numpy array of all the grades? (excluding the other information)
#   hint: use the separate lists to create a list of lists to initialize your array

# Now, try to do the following for all four data structures: list of dictionaries, separate lists, dataframe, array.
# Don't spend more than 20 minutes on any of these!
# Thinking about a solution is more important than actually programming it.
# 1. Get all the information belonging to the 20th student
# 2. Find the student with the highest linguistics grade
# 3. Calculate the average grade per student; (maths + linguistics + psychology) / 3
# What operations do you find easier to do in each of these four structures? And what operations harder?
